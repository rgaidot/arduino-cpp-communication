arduino-cpp-communication
=========================
Communication Arduino <-> Computer over USB port (serial) 
Requires libboost system and thread (libboost-thread-dev and libboost-system-dev in debian) 
Works well on raspberry pi with debian wheezy (http://www.linuxsystems.it/2012/06/debian-wheezy-raspberry-pi-minimal-image/)
